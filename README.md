# JENTIS Coding Challenge

## Brief

### Foreword

For the following task act like you are a part of our team. This means doing all the things you think a good software developer and team member should do. What we exactly mean by this is intentionally left open as we are interested to see what you think a professional developer's job is.

You are allowed to use every programming language or technology you see fit and you will have to upload the code to this repository(bitbucket or github) you created.

Please make sure to dockerize your service and upload the docker-compose.yaml (including your service dependencies) as well.

### The Challenge

Business Insights

A bookstore owner wants a very rudimentary software she can use to keep track of stock. She has to add books to the stock if she receives a delivery and she wants to delete books from stock if they are bought. Furthermore, she wants to get notified if a book is running out of stock so she can order more.

The job will be split between two developers. One junior dev will create the microservice (called service-notifier) that takes care of notifications and you will create the API and be the architect of data structures and interfaces.

### Task

Write a server with an API that takes care of storing and deleting books from stock. First, define all the properties the book will have. Then create an API (REST, GraphQl, or SOAP) that enables the bookstore owner to solve her problems described above.

Additionally, you have to create interface documentation from your service to the service-notifier so that your colleague knows what the data his service will receive looks like.

Now...the next Steps:

After you are done please send an email to us to make an appointment for the technical interview, where we will discuss your solution.

Please write down your thoughts on two topics:

If and how your service could be improved in future versions?

If this challenge description would be a ticket/epic description is there something you are missing? If so, what?

Let me know if you have any questions!
